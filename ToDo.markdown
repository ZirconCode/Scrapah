ReStructure:
	- Gateway: used to acess internet
	- Cache: used by gateway to reduce necessary acess
	- Storage: used by cache (when asked to) and by scraper to store results
	- State: used by scraper to store current state
	- Helpers: helpers ranging from getting google results (context aware!) to email extraction
	- Results... how store, analyse/interpret?, clean, filter?

	- ? Which functionalities can be exported?
	- ? Scrapers: different structures of scraper? (ex. spider,etc...)

Scraper Should be Able To:
	- save/load entire status
	- ^ pause/resume at any given time
	-
